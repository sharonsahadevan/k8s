Types of Mounts in hostPath
===========================

The Directory type will mount a directory from the host. It must exist on the given path. 
If it doesn’t, we might switch to DirectoryOrCreate type which serves the same purpose. The difference is that DirectoryOrCreate will create the directory if it does not exist on the host.

The File and FileOrCreate are similar to their Directory equivalents. 
The only difference is that this time we’d mount a file, instead of a directory.

The other supported types are Socket, CharDevice, and BlockDevice. 
They should be self-explanatory. If you don’t know what character or block devices are, you probably don’t need those types.

Note:
hostPath is a great solution for accessing host resources like /var/run/docker.sock, /dev/cgroups, and others. That is, as long as the resource we’re trying to reach is on the same node as the Pod.
