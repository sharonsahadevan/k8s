Types of Mounts in hostPath
===========================

The Directory type will mount a directory from the host. It must exist on the given path. 
If it doesn’t, we might switch to DirectoryOrCreate type which serves the same purpose. The difference is that DirectoryOrCreate will create the directory if it does not exist on the host.

The File and FileOrCreate are similar to their Directory equivalents. 
The only difference is that this time we’d mount a file, instead of a directory.

The other supported types are Socket, CharDevice, and BlockDevice. 
They should be self-explanatory. If you don’t know what character or block devices are, you probably don’t need those types.

Note:
hostPath is a great solution for accessing host resources like /var/run/docker.sock, /dev/cgroups, and others. That is, as long as the resource we’re trying to reach is on the same node as the Pod.

Do use hostPath to mount host resources like /var/run/docker.sock and /dev/cgroups. Do not use it to inject configuration files or store the state of an application.

The gitRepo Volume type allows a third field which we haven’t used. We could have set a specific revision of the repository. But, for demo purposes, the HEAD should do.

The gitRepo Volume type helps us move git commands (e.g., git clone) into the YAML definition. It also removes the need for the git binary inside containers. While gitRepo might not always be the best option, it is indeed something worth considering.
