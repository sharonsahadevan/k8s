Rules
A Rule is a set of operations (verbs), resources, and API groups. Verbs describe activities that can be performed on resources which belong to different API Groups.


Roles
A Role is a collection of Rules. It defines one or more Rules that can be bound to a user or a group of users.

Subjects
Subjects define entities that are executing operations. A Subject can be a User, a Group, or a Service Account.

Rolebindings
As the name suggests, RoleBindings bind Subjects to Roles.
Since Subjects define users, RoleBindings effectively bind users (or Groups or Service Accounts) to Roles, thus giving them permissions to perform certain operations on specific objects within a Namespace. Just like roles, RoleBindings have a cluster-wide alternative called ClusterRoleBindings. The only difference is that their scope is not limited to a Namespace, but applied to a whole cluster.
