ClusterIP
============
ClusterIP (the default type) exposes the port only inside the cluster. Such a port would not be accessible from anywhere outside. ClusterIP is useful when we want to enable communication between Pods and still prevent any external access.

If NodePort is used, ClusterIP will be created automatically.

LoadBalancer
=============
The LoadBalancer type is only useful when combined with cloud providerâ€™s load balancer.


ExternalName
=================
ExternalName maps a service to an external address (e.g., kubernetes.io).
