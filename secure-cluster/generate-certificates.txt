Install openssl

create a User and a directory to store the keys

mkdir keys
openssl genrsa -out keys/jdoe.key 2048

use the private key to generate the certificate

openssl req -new \
    -key keys/jdoe.key \
    -out keys/jdoe.csr \
    -subj "/CN=jdoe/O=devs"
    
 Creating Final Certificate 
 
 For the final certificate, we’ll need the cluster’s certificate authority (CA). It will be responsible for approving the request and for generating the necessary certificate John will use to access the cluster.

Since we used Minikube, the authority is already produced for us as part of the cluster creation. It should be in the .minikube directory inside the OS user’s home folder.

openssl x509 -req \
    -in keys/jdoe.csr \
    -CA ~/.minikube/ca.crt \
    -CAkey ~/.minikube/ca.key \
    -CAcreateserial \
    -out keys/jdoe.crt \
    -days 365
    
    John does not need the jdoe.csr file. We used it only to generate the final certificate jdoe.crt. He will need all the other files though.
    
    
Getting the server address

SERVER=$(kubectl config view \
    -o jsonpath='{.clusters[?(@.name=="minikube")].cluster.server}')

echo $SERVER
